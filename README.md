# 🎒 Campus Lost & Found Platform

An AI-Ready Full-Stack Campus Lost & Found Management System built using **Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, EJS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**. The platform helps students and faculty report lost or found items, intelligently match items, submit ownership claims, communicate securely, and manage the entire recovery process through an admin dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Campus Lost & Found Platform digitizes the traditional lost-and-found process by providing a centralized system where users can:

- Report lost items
- Report found items
- Upload item images
- Search reported items
- View intelligent match suggestions
- Submit ownership claims
- Manage profiles
- Receive notifications (ready for integration)
- Enable administrators to monitor and manage the entire system

The project is designed to be **AI-ready**, allowing future integration with Generative AI services like **Google Gemini** for intelligent item matching and image analysis.
